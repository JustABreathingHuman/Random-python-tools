Python sockets stuff:

**ChatClient.py** and **ChatServer.py**: Slightly more poliished console based chat script using the sockets library. Needs barelib.py to run.

**bareclient.py** and **bareserver.py**: Bare bones client and server. Also needs barelib.py to run.

How to use it:

server: just press enter 2 times. the default ip/port is 0.0.0.0/5667. for hosting across networks, use playit.gg and create a TCP protocol tunnel with the local ip as 5667.

client: ip is either the host's IPv4 adress (use ipconfig) or the hosting location (leading-hon.gl.at.ply.gg if using playit.gg) while the port is either host's chosen port (default 5667) or the one shown in playit.gg.
